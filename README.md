1. Instructions
Work individually on this assignment and submit code via Canvas.
Submit a live website URL, Github repository URL, source files, readme.txt and the report.
The live website is needed to be hosted using GitHub Pages.
Canvas submissions will be used for grading.
2. Requirements
You are going to develop an online bookstore. As the first step, you need to create a static website version to get feedback from your senior developers. You need to build four pages in this phase.

Home page
Category page
Book detail page
Contact page
Requirements for each page:
a. Home page (with main categories)
Home page layout

There are three main sections on the Home page

Header with logo image and menu navigation bar (horizontal on desktop devices and vertical on mobile devices - hamburger menu).
Footer with horizontal nav bar.
Homepage contains at least two main categories, each containing a category name as a link and at least three books displayed as links to the Book Detail page.
Links in the header nav bar include Home, Category 1, Category 2, etc.
Links in the footer nav bar include About Us, Privacy Policy, Terms, Copyright, and Contact Us (opens Contact page).
The content of these pages should be appropriate and up to your creativity.
Add rich media: at least one video.
b. Sub-Category page for each main category
category page

Same Header and Footer as Home page.
This page contains with at least two sub-categories, each with a sub-category name as a link and at least three books displayed as links to the Book Detail page.
There are at least three books for each sub-category.
c. Book detail page
Book page

Same Header and Footer as Home page.
Main with breadcrumb (Home and Category name are links), one large and three small images for the book, book price, and "Add to cart" button.
On mobile devices, rearrange the book images, price, and "Add to cart" button.
At the end of the page, display the book name and description.
d. Contact page
Same Header and Footer as Home page.
Main with a heading "Contact Us" at the top and a contact form with fields: contact purpose (dropdown = "I want to sell books" or "I want to buy books"), name (text), email (email), phone (phone), contact preference (checkboxes = "By email" and "By phone"), receive weekly newsletter (radios = "Yes" and "No". The "Yes" radio is checked by default.), and extra notes (textarea).
On mobile devices, position each input and its respective label on different lines (except labels for individual checkboxes and radios).
At the end of the form, add two buttons: submit and reset.
Note that you have to set the name, id, etc. of the input elements properly. Except for the "Note" field (and two buttons at the bottom of course), all other fields are required.


Please note: Make sure the website does not have any broken url link (all links are functional) so it is necessary to create multiple book detail pages. In theory, considering the requirement of at least 2 main categories, 2 sub-categories for each main category, and 3 books for each sub-category, the website should have at least 12 book detail pages for different books. It is advised to complete the design of the book detail for one book first then populate it for other books to save time.

 

To help you understand what is the different between main categories and sub categories, here are some explanations and examples:

In the context of books and other forms of media, main categories refer to broad classifications that group similar types of content together. For example, some main categories of books might include fiction, non-fiction, children's books, reference books, and textbooks.

Subcategories, on the other hand, are more specific classifications that exist within a main category. They break down the main category into smaller, more focused groups. For example, within the main category of fiction, there are many subcategories, such as literary fiction, romance, science fiction, fantasy, and mystery/thriller.

Here are some examples of main categories and their sub-categories of books (Yours can be different):

Fiction

Literary Fiction
Romance
Science Fiction
Fantasy
Mystery/Thriller
Horror
Historical Fiction
Young Adult

There are three ranges of screen sizes which we will test your website:
Small and mobile screens: width of the screen < 768px
Medium and tablet screens: 768px ≤ width of the screen < 992px
Large and desktop/laptop screens: width of the screen ≥ 992px
Header nav bar: vertical on mobile devices and horizontal on desktop devices.
Book detail page: for mobile devices, re-arrange the book images, price, and "Add to cart" button as the image below. For desktop devices, use the original image above.
Contact form: for mobile devices, each input and its respective label are positioned on different lines (except the labels for individual checkboxes and radios). For desktop devices, each input and its respective label are positioned on the same line.
Add custom font(s) to the website.
Use CSS Flexbox to create more responsive and dynamic layouts.
Use CSS transitions or animations to add interactivity to the website (e.g. For example, you could animate the hover state of links, or add a transition effect when an image is hovered over).
Use CSS to style the website and make it visually appealing and usable (regarding layouts, colors, fonts, etc).
Experiment with different color schemes and typography to create a unique and visually appealing design.

Explain briefly how you implement it.
Also, mention any extra bonus feature or work you implement beyond the required features.
Lastly, please includes:
Multiple visual aids (screenshots/illustrations/GIF/video) to show visually how to use the app and illustrate your explanation. Here are how you include them in the report:
